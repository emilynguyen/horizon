<div class="panel">
  <p>
    <p><b>What is being done to make the concert safe?</b><p><p> Student health and safety is the top priority of the concert organizers. The arena is designed to be a safe space for students. Heightened enforcement will occur at concert entrances to prevent access to visibly intoxicated students and to block prohibited substances and items from entering the event. All attendees will be screened at the entrance, including a pat down and scanning of pre-registered UCSD student IDs, prior to admission. Similar to other concert entrances, drug recognition experts will be present to intervene with any intoxicated students, and security staff will use drug-detection dogs as a safety measure to ensure the concert is a drug-free space. Students who do show up under the influence of drugs or alcohol will be unable to enter Horizon. They also can be subject to arrest or other consequences related to violation of the UC San Diego Student Code of Conduct and/or taken to appropriate medical care.</p> <p> As in years past, educational programs around the concert focus on key topics such as drug and alcohol safety and sexual assault prevention. In addition, the “floaties” bystander intervention training program has been expanded and student “floaties” who have gone through the training program will have a large presence at this year’s Horizon. ASCE is also supporting other initiatives and groups on campus working to educate and support the development of students’ understanding of these issues.</p> <p><b> What happens if I show up to the event intoxicated?</b></p><p> To ensure the concert is a safe space, students visibly intoxicated and under the influence of drugs or alcohol will be unable to enter Horizon. Heightened enforcement will occur at the concert entrance. All attendees will be screened, including a pat down and scanning of pre-registered UCSD student IDs, prior to admission. Similar to other concert entrances, drug recognition experts will be present to intervene with any intoxicated students, and security staff will use drug-detection dogs as a safety measure to ensure the concert is a drug-free space. Students who do show up under the influence of drugs or alcohol can be subject to arrest or other consequences related to violation of the UC San Diego Student Code of Conduct and/or taken to appropriate medical care.</p> <p><b> Are there special campus health & safety policies the week of Sun God?</b></p><p>Yes, to ensure that the UCSD campus is a safe space for all members of our community, enhancements and revisions to campus policies and protocols will be in effect during the week of the concert. To learn more, please contact your college's Residence Life office or visit the <a href='https://students.ucsd.edu/sponsor/student-conduct/' target='_blank'>UCSD Student Conduct website</a>.</p>

(Valid UCSD ID required)</p> <p><b>Do I need a wristband to get in?</p></b> <p>Wristbands will be distributed to approximately the first 800 students who enter the venue.

<div class="panel">
  <p>
    <ol><li>Do NOT mix drugs and alcohol. There is no way to anticipate how your body will react to the mixture- the reaction could be very serious or even fatal.</li> <li>Remember: You never know what you are actually taking. Though distributors may assure you that you are getting a certain drug, there is a high likelihood that this drug has been cut with something else, or is a different drug entirely. This is especially common with pills.</li> <li>If you do choose to engage in drug use:<ul><li> Test your pills with an affordable drug testing kit, like those sold at dancesafe.org. DISCLAIMER: Drug testing kits do not indicate that a substance is safe. Drug use is never 100% safe.</li> <li>Make sure to remain hydrated. A good rule of thumb is to drink about two cups of water (500ml) every hour. Be careful to not consume water too quickly- this can cause an electrolyte imbalance that could become fatal.</li> <li>If you do not feel well, seek help immediately! DO NOT SLEEP IT OFF. The symptoms of drug overdose can be the same, more exaggerated, or totally different than those of excessive alcohol use.</li> <li>You WILL NOT be punished for your drug/alcohol use retroactively if you seek help from an official. Your safety is our first priority.</li></ul> <li>For friends of people who are engaging in drug use:<ul><li> Monitor your friend, and make sure they are drinking enough water.</li> <li>If they are displaying extreme or out of character behavior, get them help.

   <div class="accordion"><h2>Sexual Assault Prevention</h2></div>
<div class="panel">
  <p>
    <h2>Clarifying Consent</h2><ul><li> Consent is a mutual, affirmative, voluntary, and revocable agreement by each participant to engage in sexual activity. An informed verbal “yes” must accompany positive and engaging body language. </li><li>The initiator of sexual activity is responsible for receiving consent from their partner. Obtaining consent is a continuous process, meaning consent to kissing doesn’t mean consent to everything else. Consent is voluntary and can be withdrawn at any time. Consent must be given without coercion, force, threats or intimidation by the initiator. </li><li>Consent cannot be given when someone is under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol. However, perpetrators may attempt to use alcohol and/or drugs to facilitate a sexual assault. Statistically, the majority of reported sexual assaults occur while one or both parties are under the influence of alcohol or drugs.  Alcohol or drugs is never an excuse for choosing to violate another person. </li><li>There are a number of drugs that may be added to beverages with the intent of altering the consciousness or incapacitating a person without their knowledge. Substances are particularly dangerous when combined with alcohol, and often produce amnesia, leaving a victim unclear about what occurred.  These drugs can facilitate criminal activity, most often acts of sexual misconduct or sexual assault. </li><li>Sexual assault is any unwanted, non-consensual behavior from kissing and fondling to rape. Ignorance of the law or of University policy concerning sexual assault, sexual misconduct and sexual harassment is never an excuse for non-consensual sexual behavior. </li></ul> <h2 class='mt-1 mb-1'>Preventing Sexual Assault</h2> <p> Keeping UC San Diego safe is a community responsibility. Check out the tips below on how you can help prevent sexual assault:</p> <ul><li> Identify common behaviors that often precede an assault. Recognizable red flags include seeing someone who is attempting to separate an intoxicated individual from their friends, or continuing to pour drinks for an individual who is clearly beyond their limit. </li><li>Take action as a responsive bystander and remember to use <a href='https://students.ucsd.edu/sponsor/sarc/programs/ideas.html' target='_blank'>IDEAS</a> if you see those behaviors happening.  You can help someone who is intoxicated by reconnecting them with their friends, or calling a CSO to escort that person home. You can also notify any of the festival volunteers or law enforcement officials on site if you are concerned for someone’s safety and well-being. </li></ul> <h2 class='mt-1 mb-1'>Supporting Survivors of Sexual Assault</h2><p> If something happens to a friend, know you can be a responsive bystander by showing your support:</p> <ul> <li>Listen and believe them. Let them know that you care.</li> <li>Remember sexual assault is never the fault of the survivor.</li> <li>Be aware of your response and respect their decisions.</li> <li>Know the resources and seek support for yourself.</li> </ul> <h2 class='mt-1 mb-1'>Resources</h2><p> <a href='https://students.ucsd.edu/sponsor/sarc/index.html' target='_blank'>CARE at the Sexual Assault Resource Center</a> is a confidential and free resource for all students, staff, and faculty affected by sexual assault, relationship violence, and stalking. If you or a friend need to speak with a confidential CARE advocate, call 858-534-5793. </p>

   <div class="accordion"><h2>Other Important Party Tips</h2></div>
<div class="panel">
  <p>
    <ul> <li>DO NOT serve alcohol to anyone under 21 and if you are under 21, don’t consume alcohol.</li> <li>If your neighbors call or stop by to tell you the party is too loud, be a good neighbor and turn down the volume.</li> <li>It’s okay to call the police if a party gets out of hand.</li> <li>If a guest has had too much to drink, don’t let them drive home. Call a taxi or arrange for a ride with another guest who is sober, or invite them to stay over. </li><li>Acquaint yourself with the San Diego County social host laws and the consequences of breaking those laws. If caught breaking these laws, social hosts will be held accountable and may be: 1) cited/arrested, 2) fined up to $1000 or more, 3) serve up to 6 months in jail, and 4) be billed for law enforcement services. </li><li>Inside the concert or out, if you are approached by a police or security officer, comply with them. This will minimize your chances of further consequences and will help them get you the help you need. </li> </ul>

    <p><b>Sleep</b> — Sleep impacts your physical health and your cognitive functioning. Be sure to get plenty of sleep prior to the event. Be aware that alcohol and caffeine can have a negative impact on your sleep. </p> <p> <b>Exercise</b> — Regular exercise and physical activity help to improve your mood and cope with stress and anxiety.</p> <p> <b>Eating</b> — Eating right is an important part of stress management, helps you maintain energy throughout the day, improves cognitive performance, and keeps your mood steady.</p> <p> <b>Time Management</b> — Prepare in advance for the amount of time you’ll need to study for midterm exams. When you know you have a large event coming up that will take a lot of time (e.g., attending a wedding, a birthday party, SUN GOD!), it’s important to plan effectively. Start weeks in advance and schedule study time around this large event. This way you can actually enjoy the event while you are there!  It will also reduce the likelihood of you having to cram and pull an “all-nighter.”</p> <p> <b>Social support</b> — Relationships are one of the most important factors of well-being. Developing, deepening, and maintaining close, supportive relationships help us to flourish. While at UCSD, it’s important to not just focus on academics, but to find a sense of belonging and community; to be part of a group in which you feel you are a valued member. Close relationships help to reduce loneliness and provide support during stressful times.</p> <p> <b>Find your passion</b> — Find at least one interest or hobby that you can pursue and look forward to once or twice a week. “Engagement” in activities in which you get completely absorbed and feel perfectly challenged, neither bored nor overwhelmed, can be extremely rewarding and help us to flourish.</p> <p> For more information about Tritons Flourish, please visit <a href='https://caps.ucsd.edu/flourish' target='_blank'>https://caps.ucsd.edu/flourish</a>.</p> <p> For more information about Counseling and Psychological services available on campus, please visit <a href='http://caps.ucsd.edu/' target='_blank'>http://caps.ucsd.edu/</a>. </p>
