- title: Health & Safety
  content: "<p><b>What is being done to make the concert safe?</b><p><p> Student health and safety is the top priority of the concert organizers. The arena is designed to be a safe space for students. Heightened enforcement will occur at concert entrances to prevent access to visibly intoxicated students and to block prohibited substances and items from entering the event. All attendees will be screened at the entrance, including a pat down and scanning of pre-registered UCSD student IDs, prior to admission. Similar to other concert entrances, drug recognition experts will be present to intervene with any intoxicated students, and security staff will use drug-detection dogs as a safety measure to ensure the concert is a drug-free space. Students who do show up under the influence of drugs or alcohol will be unable to enter Horizon. They also can be subject to arrest or other consequences related to violation of the UC San Diego Student Code of Conduct and/or taken to appropriate medical care.</p> <p> As in years past, educational programs around the concert focus on key topics such as drug and alcohol safety and sexual assault prevention. In addition, the “floaties” bystander intervention training program has been expanded and student “floaties” who have gone through the training program will have a large presence at this year’s Horizon. ASCE is also supporting other initiatives and groups on campus working to educate and support the development of students’ understanding of these issues.</p> <p><b> What happens if I show up to the event intoxicated?</b></p><p> To ensure the concert is a safe space, students visibly intoxicated and under the influence of drugs or alcohol will be unable to enter Horizon. Heightened enforcement will occur at the concert entrance. All attendees will be screened, including a pat down and scanning of pre-registered UCSD student IDs, prior to admission.
